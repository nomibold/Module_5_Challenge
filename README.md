# Module_5_Challenge

We are creating a financial planner for emergences and retirement. 
Evaluating the Crypto wallet by using the requests library by collencting the current prices for Bitcoin and Etherium.
Then we are evaluating the stock and bond by using the Alpaca SDK by making an API call to Alpaca. 
Evaluate the emergency fund by checking to see if the members have enough savings to build the emergency fund. 
Created a python list with the total values of the crypto, stock and bond portions. 
Then we created a Pandas DataFrame and used it to plot a pie chart. 

Now for the second part, we create a financial palanner for retirement by running the Monte Carlo simulatoins to forecast the porfolio performance for 30 years and 10 years. 
We used the MCForecastTools library and played with the portfolio ratio split. 
We plotted a line plot and a histogram for better understanding.
Generated summary statistics for both 10 and 30 years to compare and found out what the lower and upper bounds for the expected value of the portfolio with a 95% confidence interval was.
